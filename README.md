Final Coding check in for COM 372, Spring 2015

## The Assignment
For this assignment, you will create a simple multi-page website in html and css. Think of this as a dress-rehersal for your final project. If you become stuck on this assignment, come by my office for help ASAP.

You will find in this repository several text files. Each text file contains a recipe, the title and tagline of an imaginary recipe website, and the names of the recipes contained in the other text files. To complete the assignment:

1. Make each text file into a valid html file by adding the doctype declaration, the necessary tags for basic html structure (html, head, title, body), and the meta tag using the charset attribute to set the character set declaration (look at any of our exercises and you will be able to find examples of all of this).
2. Add basic html tags to mark headings, lists, links, sections, and paragraphs in the body of each of your new html files. Nest the site title and tagline inside of a header tag. Nest the navigation links inside of a nav tag.
3. Find an appropriate image for each recipe somewhere on the web (make sure it is free!). Resize each image so it has an appropriate size for the intended recipe page, save the image in the repository folder, and then include the image in the appropriate html document using the img tag.
4. Create a new external stylesheet, style.css, and link it to each of the html pages.
5. Define css rules in the stylesheet to apply an attractive and appropriate visual design to your recipe site. Your visual style should use contrast to highlight important information, organize related elements (especially the header and nav elements) close to each other to establish proximity, and carefully align page elements with no messy out-of-alignment elements.  Use at least the font-family, color, background-color, float, margin, padding, border, and font-size rules. You may also use any other css rules you wish to try.
